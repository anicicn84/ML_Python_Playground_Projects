# Problem statement

In this code example we have a file `pizza.txt` where the values are given of the historic data for a restaurant:
  1. Number of reservations per day
  2. Amount of pizzas made that day

The goal is to try to make a linear fitting to predict the amount of pizza dough for a specific number of reservations, so that we do not have too much, nor too less dough prepared.
